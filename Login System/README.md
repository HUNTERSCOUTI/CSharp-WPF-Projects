# Login System with SQLite database

This is my first project in WPF and I decided to work with SQLite database as I'm gonna be making a lot of projects with databases.
The program is able to save a Username, Password and a GUID that is assigned when signing up in the .db file.

The project was never meant to be perfect and I've made it only to test things such as view switching, designing and implementation of SQLite.
I'm aware of bugs and features needing to be added, however I won't be working on this for now as I'll maybe implement a better version of this into a future project.
